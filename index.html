    <h1>The History of the Basotho people</h1>
<br>
    <p>
    The origins of the Basotho people began due to a cultural cluster from present-day Gaborone all the way to Johannesburg. The Basotho people(Southen Sotho) are related to Batwana and Bapedi people.This cluster began to disperse around the 15th century with the Basotho people migrating to the south and the east, whereby they intermixed with the San people, as well as diverse indivuals of Nguni origins. The language spoken today by Basotho people(Sesotho) indicates those influences, as do other features including music, architecture and etc showing the forever increasing interpenetration of the the Nguni culture. Thus showcasing the diffrence between 
    South sotho, Pedi and Tswana. Here's the <a href="https://www.morijamuseum.org/indigenousmusic">link</a>for further information.
